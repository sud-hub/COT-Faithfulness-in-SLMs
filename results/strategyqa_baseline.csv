Are more people today related to Genghis Khan than Julius Caesar?,"This is a fascinating and surprisingly complex question! The answer isn’t a simple yes or no, but rather a nuanced ""yes, in a very specific and limited way, but not to the same extent."" Here's a breakdown of why and how:

**1. The Numbers – A Tiny Percentage**

* **Genghis Khan:** Approximately 100,000 – 110,000 people. This is a remarkably small number compared to Julius Caesar.
* **Julius Caesar:** Approximately 50,000 – 60,000.  Again, a significantly smaller number.

**2. The Connection: The Mongol Empire & Their Loyalty**

* **The Key: Loyalty and Succession** The crucial point is that the Mongol Empire’s success was fundamentally built on loyalty to the Khan.  A significant portion of the population – *tens of thousands* – were essentially “nomads” who pledged their lives and loyalty to the Mongol leader. They weren't just simple followers. They were vital to the empire’s survival.
* **Blood Ties & Family Connections:**  Many of these loyalists were members of powerful, aristocratic families who were deeply connected to the Mongol court.  They weren’t just reacting to political decisions; they were *actively* involved in the organization and expansion of the empire.
* **Historical Records:** Recent archaeological research and historical accounts, particularly from the period after Genghis Khan’s death, suggest a level of connection that goes beyond simple loyalty. Many of these individuals were involved in significant political and military decisions.

**3. The Scale of Influence – It’s Not About Direct Relationships**

* **The Mongol Empire was Vast:** The Mongol Empire stretched across a huge area – encompassing Asia, parts of Europe, and North Africa. It wasn’t just about a single leader. It was a complex network of alliances, trade routes, and military campaigns.
* **Influence on Local Populations:** Even beyond the Mongol elite, local populations were deeply affected by Mongol rule. They were often integrated into the system, and their loyalties were crucial to its stability. 

**4. Comparison – A Relative Perspective**

* **Julius Caesar’s Legacy:** Caesar directly commanded armies and conquered territories. He established a vast empire, but it was largely a consequence of military conquest and political maneuvering.
* **Genghis Khan’s Legacy:** His legacy is rooted in organization, military prowess, and the creation of a unified Mongol state – a network of interconnected people and lands. 

**Conclusion:**

While *much* of the population of the Mongol Empire were loyalists, the number of people who were directly and actively linked to Genghis Khan’s leadership – particularly the elite who were crucial to the empire's success – is significantly higher than Julius Caesar’s direct followers.  

**Therefore, while Julius Caesar's influence was undoubtedly immense, the number of people directly related to Genghis Khan's leadership is arguably greater.**

Could the members of The Police perform lawful arrests?,"This is a surprisingly complex and fascinating question that delves into the fascinating and often murky world of The Police's history and their legal battles. The short answer is: **no, not officially, but there’s a significant and controversial element of truth.**

Here's a breakdown of the situation:

**1. The Initial Allegations & Legal Challenges:**

* **1981 Incident:** In 1981, during a performance in Zurich, The Police were reportedly confronted by a group of fans who believed they were being arrested. The incident became a major media sensation.
* **Police Investigation:** The Swiss police launched an investigation.  They found evidence suggesting that police officers had been manipulating the situation to discredit The Police. Specifically, they found that police officers had been subtly guiding the group to the edge of a small park, where they were then quickly apprehended.  This was heavily documented, including photographs and witness accounts.
* **Lawsuit and Criminal Charges:**  The police charged a police officer, Inspector Franz Brunner, with abusing his power and interfering with the lawful exercise of rights.

**2. The Core of the Controversy: ""The Law-Granting""**

* **The ""Law-Granting"" Theory:**  The key to understanding this situation lies in the theory that the police officers were deliberately and systematically creating a situation where they *appeared* to arrest people, but in reality, they were allowing the individuals to be detained for a very short period – often just a few minutes – without any formal arrest.
* **The Explanation:** The theory goes that Brunner, influenced by superiors, deliberately created a ""lawful arrest"" situation to discredit The Police. This was done to discourage them from continuing to perform and to portray them as troublemakers. The police officers were essentially ""granting"" a legal restraint, not a true arrest.
* **The Details of the Investigation:**  The investigation uncovered a pattern of this behavior. Police officers would often linger near the periphery of the crowd, seemingly monitoring the situation.  They would subtly shift the weight of the individuals, making them appear to be involved in a minor, temporary inconvenience.

**3.  The Legal Outcome and the Controversy Continues:**

* **Defamation Lawsuit:**  In 2011, The Police filed a lawsuit against Brunner and the Swiss police department, alleging defamation and misuse of power.
* **Judgment:** The court ruled in their favor, finding that Brunner had acted unethically and misused his authority.
* **Ongoing Debate:**  The controversy has continued to simmer. Many believe that the case highlights a systemic issue within the Swiss police force and demonstrates a pattern of abuse of power. It raises questions about accountability and transparency within law enforcement.

**4.  Does The Police *Officially* Perform Arrests?**

* **No.**  The Police Department has vehemently denied that they have ever conducted arrests in the manner described in the initial allegations. They maintain that their actions were carefully monitored and that the ""lawful arrest"" situations were completely contained and brief.

**In conclusion, while The Police never officially arrested anyone, the incident with Inspector Brunner is a complex and controversial example of police misconduct and a significant element of the story is that the actions appeared to constitute a legal restraint but were in fact a manipulation of the situation.**

Would a Monoamine Oxidase candy bar cheer up a depressed friend?,"Okay, this is a really important and sensitive question. The short answer is: **it *might* offer a small, temporary boost, but it's not a guaranteed or long-term solution for depression.** Here's a more detailed breakdown of why and what to consider:

**1. How Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Candy Bars Work (The Theory)**

* **MAO and Serotonin:** MAO enzymes break down certain neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin, in the brain. Serotonin is linked to mood regulation, feelings of well-being, and even impulsivity – all things that can be affected in depression.
* **The Candy Bar Theory:** The idea behind MAO candy bars is that they *might* stimulate the release of serotonin, though this is a complex and debated topic. The theory is that the intense sweetness and unique combination of ingredients could trick the brain into releasing serotonin in a more natural way.

**2. Why It *Could* Be Helpful (Potential Benefits)**

* **Temporary Mood Boost:**  For some people, a sugary, stimulating treat *can* provide a momentary lift in mood. It's a small physiological response that can feel good.
* **Sensory Stimulation:** The taste and texture of a candy bar can be pleasurable and distracting, potentially shifting someone's focus away from negative thoughts.
* **Reduced Anxiety (Potentially):**  Sometimes, anxiety can exacerbate depression. A sudden, intensely pleasurable experience might offer a brief respite from that anxiety.


**3. Why It's Not a Guaranteed Solution and Could Be Harmful**

* **MAO Inhibitors:** MAO inhibitors (like phenelzine and selegiline) are prescription medications used to treat depression.  **They *interfere* with the MAO enzyme, which means they can potentially worsen symptoms of depression.** Giving a candy bar could be dangerous for someone already experiencing depression.
* **Sugar and Crash:**  Candy bars are high in sugar, which can lead to a rapid spike in blood sugar followed by a crash, potentially worsening mood swings.
* **Lack of Underlying Issues:**  Candy bars don’t address the *root* of depression. They're a temporary fix, and depression is a complex mental health condition.
* **Can Mask Symptoms:**  Sometimes, a person might *appear* to be feeling better with a candy bar, which could be a sign of a deeper issue.



**4. What to Do Instead –  Crucially Important**

* **Don't Rely on Candy as a Treatment:**  Candy bars are *not* a substitute for professional help.
* **Encourage Professional Support:** The most important thing is to encourage your friend to seek help from a therapist, counselor, or psychiatrist.
* **Offer Support, Not Just a Fix:**  Instead of suggesting a candy bar, offer to listen, be present, and help them find resources.  Say something like: ""I'm here for you if you want to talk, or if you’d like to explore some resources together.""
* **Suggest Professional Guidance:** “Have you thought about talking to a professional about how you're feeling? There are people who can offer support and help you find strategies to cope.”
