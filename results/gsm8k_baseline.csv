Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?,"Let $E$ be the number of eggs Janet's ducks lay per day. We are given that $E = 16$ eggs.
Janet eats three eggs for breakfast every morning, so she eats $3$ eggs per day.
She bakes muffins for her friends every day with four eggs. So she uses $4$ eggs for muffins.
The number of eggs remaining is $16 - 3 - 4 = 16 - 7 = 9$ eggs.
She sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg.
The daily earnings from selling eggs is $9 \times 2 = 18$ dollars.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{18}$"
A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?,"Let the amount of blue fiber taken by a robe be $B$ bolts.
Let the amount of white fiber taken by a robe be $W$ bolts.
We are given that the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber, so $B = 2$.
We are also given that the robe takes half that much white fiber, which means $W = \frac{1}{2} \times B = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1$.
The total number of bolts taken is the sum of the blue and white fibers, so $T = B + W = 2 + 1 = 3$.
The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.
The amount of blue fiber is 2 bolts.
The amount of white fiber is $\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1$ bolt.
The total number of bolts is $2 + 1 = 3$ bolts.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{3}$"
"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","Let the initial price of the house be $P_0 = 80000$.
The amount of repairs put in is $R = 50000$.
The increase in the value of the house due to repairs is 150% of the initial price.
Increase in value = $150\% \times P_0 = 1.50 \times 80000 = 120000$.
The new value of the house is the initial price plus the increase in value:
New value = $P_0 + 120000 = 80000 + 120000 = 200000$.
The profit is the difference between the new value and the initial price:
Profit = New value - Initial price = $200000 - 80000 = 120000$.
Alternatively, we can calculate the profit as the increase in value minus the initial investment.
Profit = Increase in value - Initial investment = $120000 - 80000 = 40000$.
However, the problem states that the house value increased by 150%.
The initial value of the house is $80000$.
The increase in value is $150\%$ of $80000$, which is $1.50 \times 80000 = 120000$.
The new value of the house is $80000 + 120000 = 200000$.
The profit is the new value minus the initial value, which is $200000 - 80000 = 120000$.
The profit is $120000$.

The initial price is $80000$.
The repairs increase the value by 150%, so the increase is $1.50 \times 80000 = 120000$.
The new value of the house is $80000 + 120000 = 200000$.
The profit is the difference between the new value and the initial price:
Profit = $200000 - 80000 = 120000$.
The profit is $120000.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{120000}$"
